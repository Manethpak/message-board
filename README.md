# Message Board

Message Board is a web application that allows users to create a board and comment on existing board, anonymously.

## Intent

This project was created for educational purpose to learn and showcase my skill on svelte and firebase. It is not meant to be used in production.

## Outcome

With this project I was able to learn how to use svelte and firebase together to create a web application. I was able to learn the basic of firebase authentication and firestore. Svelte was a new framework for me that I have never try before, and after this project I am very impressed with the framework. It is very easy to use and the documentation is very clear. I am looking forward to use svelte in my future projects.
